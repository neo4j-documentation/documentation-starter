= Source Blocks
:page-pagination:


== Copy Button

The **Copy To Clipboard** button will appear on all code blocks:

[source,adoc]
----
[source,adoc]
Copy me!
----

Unless you add `role=nocopy`:

.Source block with role=nocopy
[source,adoc,role=nocopy]
----
[source,adoc,role=nocopy]
Don't copy me!
----

== Play In Browser

Source blocks with a type of cypher will have a deeplink to run the query in Neo4j Browser

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)
----

Unless you add `role=noplay`

.Source block with `role=noplay`
[source,cypher,role=noplay]
----
[source,adoc,role=noplay]
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)
----



== Combining `nocopy` and `noplay`

You can combine `noplay` and `nocopy`:

[source,cypher]
----
[source,adoc,role=nocopy noplay]
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)
----

[source,cypher,role=nocopy noplay]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)
----

== Suppress Headers

You can suppress the header by adding `role=noheader`

[source]
----
[source,role=noheader]
No header!
----

[source,role=noheader]
No header!



== Tabbed Source Blocks

If you are writing a tutorial for multiple languages, you can use the `[.tabs]` directive to include tabs.
The text on the tab will default to the title, or fallback to the language if no title is supplied.
When clicking on a tab, all other tab sets with the same title will also be made active across the page.

[source,adoc]
----
include::example$preview.adoc[tag=tabs]
----

The script will find all HTML `div` elements with a class of `tabs`, then iterate through the next sibling while the element contains a code block until it reaches one without.
At this point, if the number of elements is more than one, it will create a set of tabs and add event listeners to switch the tabs on click.
