The aim of documentation is to guide a user from a complete beginner through to being an expert.
At each stage, they will require content of a different style:

* *Introduction*: A wordy article explaining what the article is, where it should be used and what the benefits are
* xref:installation.adoc[Installation] - I know what it is, now how do I install it?
* xref:tutorial.adoc[Tutorial] - Now I have installed it, what do I do next?
* xref:how-to-guide.adoc[How-To Guide] - OK, I kind of know what I'm doing but I need a more concrete example
* xref:troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting] - I've got a really common problem, can I solve it without scrolling through pages of Stack Overflow or Community Posts?
* xref:graph-app.adoc[Graph App (Optional)] - What resources are available for me to learn more?
* xref:reference.adoc[Documentation (Reference)] - I know what I'm doing but I need to find something specific - for example a configuration option
